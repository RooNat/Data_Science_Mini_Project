## Summative assessment



This unit is assessed by coursework, which is divided into three components:

-   **Group Oral Presentation (20%)**, produced collectively by all three or four team-members in each group, this should last no more than 10mins (+/- 30 seconds), followed by a group question-and-answer (Q&A) session (around 5 minutes). The presentations will be scheduled after the written report deadline below, dates and times to be announced shortly.  
    This will be assessed on the structure, content, and clarity of the presentation, the coverage of technical matters, and the quality of the answers in the Q&A session.  
    **NOTE: For presentation schedule and Teams Links, please see below.**
    
-   **Group Written Report (65%),** with all three or four team-members listed as co-authors, written in the style and format of a short conference-paper, with all associated code and scripts being made available in a private GitHub repository (ensure your report includes the URL!).  
    The Written Report will be assessed on the following criteria: the statement/explanation of the problem and its business context; discussion of relevant prior work (and citations to relevant publications); explanations of the approaches you tried, and the rationale for each (i.e., why you tried them); visualization, analysis, and discussion of the results; discussion of further work that you would do if you had more time/resources, and your overall conclusions. See the recommended structure and assessment details below.  
    The format of your paper should be **NO MORE THAN 8 PAGES** of A4 paper formatted according to the IEEE conference-proceedings template (in [Word](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-6968280-dt-content-rid-28390898_2/xid-28390898_2 "Report Word Template") or [LaTeX Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gktkxndzyykb "Report LaTeX Template in Overleaf") format); it is important that you **DO NOT** deviate from this standard template. Each team should prepare ONE group written report, and then each team-member should submit a copy of that report via the coursework upload mechanism. That is, every student should submit a copy of their co-authored paper, in PDF format, via the Blackboard DSMP Report Submission page, once enabled.
-   **Individual Reflective Report (15%):** this should contain the following two sections, using single line-spacing and 11pt Times New Roman font and with all margins set to 2cm:
    -   A visualisation of your individual project activity from Github repository/log data and/or a visualisation of your individual project activity from your project management tool (e.g. Trello) data.  
        This section should be no longer than two pages of A4
    -   Your complete individual weekly log, which you have been recording between Weeks 15-24

##### **Submission and Naming**

Written submissions:

-   Please ensure both your project report and individual reflection documents are A4 sized in PDF format, formatted as specified above.
-   These documents should be named: groupX-report.pdf and groupX-username-reflect.pdf  
    e.g. _group41-report.pdf_ and _group41-tl18303-reflect.pdf_
-   They should then be uploaded on the assessment submission pages, which will be enabled nearer to the deadlines.

Additionally:

-   Ensure your project report includes a link to your private GitHub repository
-   Your GitHub repository must be shared with staff, following the process in the emails sent out to all groups by Week 23. The basic procedure is as follows:
    -   In GitHub, click your repository and go to Settings > Manage Access > Invite a Collaborator
    -   Enter and confirm the username provided in the email to your group
    -   GitHub shows this as 'invited' or 'pending' until we accept

Oral submissions:

-   The 15 minute live sessions (presentation of 10 minutes, Q&A of 5 minutes) are scheduled from Monday 15th May through Thursday 18th May, see (TBD). 
-   We would encourage you to attend in person if you can.
-   **All presentations MUST be submitted to the project staff member by 12pm (noon) on Thursday 11th May**. These will then be copied onto a shared drive on the room's PC for use during the presentation sessions.
    -   You do not need to use your own computer (but please let us know beforehand if you have to and why).
    -   If some of your group are attending remotely, they will need to 'request control' in Teams in order to advance/control the slideshow, or another member attending in-person can control the slideshow for you.
-   In-person:
    -   Please only attend if you have worked in this project (e.g. project A), due to restricted seating.
    -   Please arrive by 12.50pm. This is a 'conference' style meeting, so we would expect you to attend for as long as you can, to support the other teams that are present.
    -   Breaks with tea, coffee and snacks will be provided.
-   Online:
    -   You are welcome to attend online no matter which project you were working on, but please keep muted and video off.
    -   Please log on to the Teams meeting by 12.55pm.
    -   Teams links for attending remotely:
