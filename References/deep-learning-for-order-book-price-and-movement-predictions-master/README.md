# Limit order book modelling with Deep Learning (LSTM network) for price and market movement predictions  

Repo contains files and data for:

* Cleaning limit order book data scraped from Binance
* Exploratory Data Analysis on ETHBTC trades and orders
* Price volatility calculation
* Feature engineering the order book and trades data for Deep Learning
* Modelling the order book using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network for market movement and price predictions
* Shap values of the created models
